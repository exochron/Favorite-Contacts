# Favorite Contacts

Favorite Contacts adds a new action bar next to your Mailbox or Crafting Orders. You can place your favorite contacts in
these slots to fill out the input form quicker.

You can add a new contact to your favorite list just by double-clicking on a free slot or by using the context menu. The
favorite contact contains the contact name and a user specified icon. To delete an existing favorite contact, drag it to
a free space. You can delete or change existing contacts also via the context menu. It's possible to change the position
of a favorite contact with drag and drop.

All addon settings and contacts are shared between all characters of the current realm.

It supports ElvUI and Masque.
