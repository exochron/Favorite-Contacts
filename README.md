# Favorite Contacts

Favorite Contacts is a simple UI addon for World of Warcraft. It adds buttons to your mailbox for easy access of your favorite contacts. If you click a contact button, the recipient of the new mail is directly set to the contact name.

You can add a new contact to your favorite list just by double clicking on a free slot or by using the context menu. The favorite contact contains the contact name and a user specified icon. To delete an existing favorite contact, drag it to a free space. You can delete or change existing contacts also via the context menu. It's possible to change the position of a favorite contact with drag and drop.

All addon settings and contacts are shared between all characters of the current realm.
